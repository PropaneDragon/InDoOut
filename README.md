# InDoOut
InDoOut is an application to allow you to easily automate tasks using a clear and simple to use drag and drop interface. It also supports a full plugin interface to allow you to extend functionality.

## Features
- Drag and drop 'blocks' that perform a single task and link them to other blocks to create a program.
- Blocks have a simple input/output interface allowing you to drag wires between them.
- Multiplatform support allows you to run a server on a different machine, whether that's Windows, Linux or even a Raspberry Pi then connect to it from a separate machine or simply run it in the background to automate common tasks.
- No programming knowledge required. Everything in IDO is visual using drag and drop. You don't need to edit any code to create programs.

## Building
